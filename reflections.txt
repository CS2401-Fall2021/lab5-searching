PART 1: LINEAR

1) What should be returned if the indexOfFailure is >= numberOfChanges? (5pts)

2) Write a one-line description of your approach (5 pts)

3) What is the big-O notation for how long this algorithm takes to run asssuming the worst case scenario? (2.5pts)

4) What about the best-case scenario? (2.5pts)

Reminder: Write 3 test cases in Main.java to ensure that your method works as intended. What are you testing in each case? (10pts)



PART 2: BINARY

1) What should be returned if indexOfFailure is negative? (5pts)

2) Write a two description of your approach. You are using binary search but....? (5 pts)

3) What is the big-O notation for how long this algorithm takes to run asssuming the worst case scenario? (2.5pts)

4) What about the best-case scenario? (2.5pts)

Reminder: Write 3 test cases in Main.java to ensure that your method works as intended. What are you testing in each case? (10pts)



PART 3: COMPARE

1) Write a one-line description of your approach (5pts)

Reminder: Write 1 test case in Main.java to ensure that your method works as intended. What are you testing in each case? (5pts)


PART 4: KEY TAKEAWAYS
1) Which method is better? Binary or Linear? Why? (5pts)

2) Is the above method ALWAYS better? If not, give an example. (5pts)
3) Assume you are Bad Luck Brain and have the worst luck in the world and always get the worst-case scenario and there are 1000 changes to check. 
      How many will you need to check for linear? (5pts)
  
      For binary? (5pts)
